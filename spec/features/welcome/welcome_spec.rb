What makes a home isnâ€™t just the roof you sleep under, but the neighborhood around you. The average person moves approximately 11.7 times in their lifetime, and that means new gyms, new utilities, and new health care providers, among other things. Relocate's user-friendly interface is a quick way to find and compare all the local businesses and necessities around you based on the location you provide."
